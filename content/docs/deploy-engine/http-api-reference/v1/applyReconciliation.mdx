          Applies reconciliation actions to resolve drift or interrupted state
          for resources

          and links in a blueprint instance.


          Actions can:

          - **accept_external**: Accept external cloud state as truth and update
          persisted state to match

          - **update_status**: Update the status only without modifying
          persisted state data

          - **mark_failed**: Mark the element as failed


          This endpoint should be called after `checkReconciliation` to apply
          the recommended

          or user-chosen actions for each element that needs reconciliation.

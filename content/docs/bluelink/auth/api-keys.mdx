description: Using API keys for authentication with Bluelink components
---

API keys can be used to authenticate with Bluelink components with HTTP APIs such as the [Deploy Engine API](/docs/deploy-engine).

API keys are shared secrets that are only known by the caller and an instance of one of the Bluelink applications.

## Creating API Keys

You can create an API key using the Bluelink CLI:
    
```bash
bluelink api-key create
```

This will generate a 256-bit cryptographically secure random string that can be used as an API key.

You can also generate an API key using tools like `openssl`:

```bash 
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Configuring API Keys

API keys can be configured using environment variables or configuration files.
You can find the supported approaches in the documentation for each Bluelink component that supports API keys.

## Revoking API Keys

To revoke API keys, delete the key from the configuration file or environment variable and restart the Bluelink component that uses the key.

## Using API Keys

To use an API key, you must include it in the `Bluelink-Api-Key` header of a HTTP request.

```
POST /v1/run HTTP/1.1
Host: api.workflow.example.com
Bluelink-Api-Key: {apiKey}
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 170
    
    {
        "workflow": "my-workflow",
        "input": {
            "foo": "bar"
        }
    }
```

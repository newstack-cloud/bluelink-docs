Let's get you up and running with **Bluelink in less than 30 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new Bluelink blueprint project**.

## Install Bluelink

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="mac">
To install Bluelink on macOS, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```
</InstallBluelink>
<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="linux">
To install Bluelink on Linux, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```
</InstallBluelink>
<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="windows">
To install Bluelink on Windows, download one the following installers:

<DownloadBluelinkInstallerWindows />

These installers will install the Bluelink CLI, Deploy Engine and the Blueprint Language Server on your system.
You will need to use the Bluelink CLI to install Deploy Engine plugins.

Or run the following command in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```

</InstallBluelink>
<InstallBluelink fallback>
To install Bluelink on macOS, Linux or another Unix-like OS, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```
</InstallBluelink>

This will run a shell script to install the [`bluelink-manager`](https://github.com/newstack-cloud/bluelink/tree/main/tools/manager) tool that will then install the [Bluelink CLI](/docs/cli/getting-started), [Deploy Engine](/docs/deploy-engine), a set of core Deploy Engine plugins and the [Blueprint Language Server](https://github.com/newstack-cloud/bluelink/tree/main/tools/blueprint-ls) on your system.
As Bluelink consists of multiple software components, the `bluelink-manager` tool makes it easier to install them and manage updates.


Using a different system or want to install another way? Check out other ways to install Bluelink for your platform [here](/docs/bluelink/installing-bluelink).

## Generate a new blueprint project

Generate a new Bluelink blueprint project using the **AWS simple API template**:

```bash
bluelink init --template aws-simple-api --project-name my-project
```

This will generate a new project that will contain sample source code, build tools and most importantly, a blueprint file that describes the infrastructure to be deployed to AWS.

The `project.blueprint.yml` file will contain an AWS API Gateway, some Lambda functions, a DynamoDB table and an S3 bucket.

For blueprint projects that represent applications, the programming languages and frameworks used in the projects will vary. Most blueprint project templates will use Python or TypeScript.

## Configure deployment to AWS

          Checks a blueprint instance for drift (external state differs from
          persisted state)

          and interrupted operations. Returns detailed information about which
          resources

          and links need reconciliation, along with recommended actions.


          Drift occurs when resources have been modified outside of the Deploy
          Engine

          (e.g., manual changes in the cloud provider console). Interrupted
          state occurs

          when a previous deployment was cancelled before completing.


          This endpoint does not modify any state - it only performs a read-only
          check

          to identify what needs reconciliation.

description: Introduction to authentication for Bluelink components

Bluelink provides a collection of helpers and specifications for authentication.
Applications with public HTTP APIs that make up Bluelink such as the [Deploy Engine](/docs/deploy-engine) support common authentication mechanisms including API keys and JWTs issued by [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) or OIDC[^1] providers.
A custom Bluelink-specific authentication mechanism is also supported that avoids the transportation of private API keys over the wire by using them in combination with a public key, timestamp and chosen request headers to create a signature, this mechanism is the called the Bluelink Signature.

## Authentication Mechanisms

You can delve deeper into the supported authentication mechanisms in the links below (including the specification for the Bluelink Signature):

- [API Keys](/docs/bluelink/auth/api-keys)
- [JWTs](/docs/bluelink/auth/jwts)
- [Bluelink Signature v1](/docs/bluelink/auth/signature-v1)

[^1]: OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization framework. See [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/).

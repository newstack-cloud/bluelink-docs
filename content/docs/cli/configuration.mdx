description: Configuring the Bluelink CLI
---

The Bluelink CLI can be configured using CLI options, a configuration file or environment variables.
It is designed to have good defaults, but sometimes you will want to customise the behaviour.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
The order of precedence for configuration is:
1. CLI options
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file
4. Default values
</Callout>

## Configuration File

The CLI looks for a configuration file in the following locations by default:
- `<rootDir>/bluelink.config.yml`
- `<rootDir>/bluelink.config.yaml`
- `<rootDir>/bluelink.config.json`
- `<rootDir>/bluelink.config.toml`

A custom configuration file can be specified using the `--config` flag.
You can explore values that can be configured in the [CLI reference](/docs/cli/reference).

## Environment Variables

The CLI can be configured using environment variables.
Environment variables prefixed with `BLUELINK_CLI_` will be picked up by the CLI.
You can explore environment variables that can be configured in the [CLI reference](/docs/cli/reference).

## Auth Configuration File

Depending on the authentication method configured for the CLI, you will need to provide a separate configuration file
for authenticating with the Deploy Engine.

By default, the CLI will look for a configuration file at `<rootDir>/engine.auth.json`, this can be overridden using
the [`--engine-auth-config-file` option](/docs/cli/reference#--engine-auth-config-file).

          Clean up events that are older than the retention period

          configured for the Deploy Engine instance.


          This will clean up events for all processes including blueprint
          validations,

          change staging and deployments.

          This will not clean up the resources themselves, only the events that
          are associated

          with the resources.

          You can clean up change sets and blueprint validations using the
          dedicated endpoints.

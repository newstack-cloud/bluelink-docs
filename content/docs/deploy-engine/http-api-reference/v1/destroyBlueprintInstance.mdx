          Destroys a blueprint deployment instance.


          This is a `POST` request as destroying a blueprint instance requires
          additional information

          beyond the ID of the instance to destroy and `DELETE` requests do not
          support request bodies.


          This will start the destroy process for the provided change set.

          It will return the current state of the blueprint instance, the same
          ID provided

          should be used to stream destroy events as they occur.

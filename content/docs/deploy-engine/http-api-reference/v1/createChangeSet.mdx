          Create a change set for a blueprint deployment.

          This will start a change staging process for the provided blueprint

          document and return an ID that can be used to retrieve the change set

          or stream change staging events.


          If a valid instance ID or name is provided, a change set will be
          created

          by comparing the provided blueprint document with the current state of
          the existing

          blueprint instance.


          Creating a change set should be carried out in preparation for
          deploying new

          blueprint instances or updating existing blueprint instances.


          Unless `skipDriftCheck` is set to true, drift detection will be
          performed

          before staging changes for existing instances. If drift is detected

          (external state differs from persisted state), a `driftDetected` event

          will be emitted on the change staging stream and the operation will
          not

          proceed with change staging. Use the reconciliation endpoints to
          resolve

          drift before retrying.

Create a change set for a blueprint deployment.
This will start a change staging process for the provided blueprint
document and return an ID that can be used to retrieve the change set
or stream change staging events.

If a valid instance ID or name is provided, a change set will be created
by comparing the provided blueprint document with the current state of the existing
blueprint instance.

Creating a change set should be carried out in preparation for deploying new
blueprint instances or updating existing blueprint instances.

Unless `skipDriftCheck` is set to true, drift detection will be performed
before staging changes for existing instances. If drift is detected
(external state differs from persisted state), a `driftDetected` event
will be emitted on the change staging stream and the operation will not
proceed with change staging. Use the reconciliation endpoints to resolve
drift before retrying.

description: How to install Bluelink for multiple platforms
---

Bluelink can be installed in several ways depending on your needs. Choose the method that works best for you.

## Installation Options

There are three ways to install Bluelink:

1. **Easy Install (Recommended)** - Use the one-line installer script or Windows installer
2. **Using Bluelink Manager** - Download the manager binary and use it to install components
3. **Manual Installation** - Download and configure each component individually

## Easy Install (Recommended)

For the quickest setup, follow the installation instructions in the [Quick Start guide](/docs/bluelink). This uses a single command to install everything you need.

## Using Bluelink Manager

The Bluelink Manager is a cross-platform CLI tool that handles the installation, updating, and management of all Bluelink components. It manages:

- **Bluelink CLI** - The command-line interface for infrastructure management
- **Deploy Engine** - A background service that handles deployments
- **Blueprint Language Server** - Provides IDE support for blueprint files

### Installing the Manager

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="mac">

To install the Bluelink Manager on macOS, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```

This will download and install the Bluelink Manager, which will then install all other components automatically.

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="linux">

To install the Bluelink Manager on Linux, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```

This will download and install the Bluelink Manager, which will then install all other components automatically.

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="windows">

For Windows, download and run the MSI installer:

<WindowsInstallerDownload />

The installer will:
- Install the Bluelink Manager
- Set up a startup application
- Prepare all necessary directories
- Configure the Deploy Engine as a Windows Service

Alternatively, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink isDefault>

To install the Bluelink Manager on macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://manager-sh.bluelink.dev | sh
```

This will download and install the Bluelink Manager, which will then install all other components automatically.

</InstallBluelink>

### Manual Download

If you prefer to download the Bluelink Manager binary directly, you can find the latest releases below:

<ReleaseTable component="bluelink-manager" />

<VerificationInstructions />

### Post-Installation (Manual Download Only)

If you downloaded the Bluelink Manager binary manually (rather than using the shell script or Windows installer), you'll need to run the install command:

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="mac">

```bash
# If bluelink-manager is in your PATH
bluelink-manager install

# Or use the full path to the binary
./bluelink-manager install
```

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="linux">

```bash
# If bluelink-manager is in your PATH
bluelink-manager install

# Or use the full path to the binary
./bluelink-manager install
```

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="windows">

```powershell
# If bluelink-manager is in your PATH
bluelink-manager install

# Or use the full path to the binary
.\bluelink-manager.exe install
```

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink isDefault>

```bash
# If bluelink-manager is in your PATH
bluelink-manager install

# Or use the full path to the binary
./bluelink-manager install
```

</InstallBluelink>

The shell script and Windows installer handle PATH configuration and run this command automatically, so you can skip this step if you used one of those methods.

This will download and install:
- The Bluelink CLI
- The Deploy Engine (configured as a background service)
- The Blueprint Language Server
- Core Deploy Engine plugins

You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
bluelink-manager status
```

### Managing Components

The Bluelink Manager provides several commands for managing your installation:

```bash
# Update all components to the latest versions
bluelink-manager update

# Start the Deploy Engine service
bluelink-manager start

# Stop the Deploy Engine service
bluelink-manager stop

# Restart the Deploy Engine service
bluelink-manager restart

# Update the manager itself
bluelink-manager self-update

# Uninstall all components
bluelink-manager uninstall
```

## Installing Components Individually

For advanced users who want granular control over the installation, you can download and install each component separately.

### Prerequisites

Before installing components manually, you need to set up the directory structure.

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="mac">

On macOS, create the following directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/bin
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/config
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/engine/plugins
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/engine/state
```

Add the bin directory to your PATH by adding this to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.bluelink/bin:$PATH"
```

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="linux">

On Linux, create the following directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/bin
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/config
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/engine/plugins
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/engine/state
```

Add the bin directory to your PATH by adding this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.bluelink/bin:$PATH"
```

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink matchPlatform="windows">

On Windows, the default installation directory is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NewStack\Bluelink\`. Create the following structure:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NewStack\Bluelink\bin"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NewStack\Bluelink\config"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NewStack\Bluelink\engine\plugins"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NewStack\Bluelink\engine\state"
```

Add the bin directory to your PATH through System Properties or by running:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NewStack\Bluelink\bin", "User")
```

</InstallBluelink>

<InstallBluelink isDefault>

Create the following directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/bin
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/config
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/engine/plugins
mkdir -p ~/.bluelink/engine/state
```

Add the bin directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.bluelink/bin:$PATH"
```

</InstallBluelink>

## Running Deploy Engine in Docker

The Deploy Engine can also be run as a Docker container, which is useful for containerised environments or if you prefer not to install it directly on your system.

### Pulling the Image

The Deploy Engine container image is available from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Pull the latest stable release
docker pull ghcr.io/newstack-cloud/deploy-engine:latest

# Or pull the nightly build for the latest features
docker pull ghcr.io/newstack-cloud/deploy-engine:nightly
```

### Running the Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name deploy-engine \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/.bluelink/engine:/data \
  ghcr.io/newstack-cloud/deploy-engine:latest
```

title: Deploy Configuration
description: Configuration for specific deployments
---

This section provides documentation for configuration that needs to be provided when carrying out a subset of commands in the CLI.

## Overview

Deploy configuration is used for blueprint variable overrides, configuration for providers (e.g. credentials for AWS), configuration for transformers and more general configuration that may be used by Deploy Engine plugins.

Deploy configuration is used with the following commands:

- `stage-changes` - Used to ensure that all the final blueprint variables are set and that providers and transformers are configured correctly when deploying resources for a new blueprint instance.
- `deploy` - Used to ensure that all the final blueprint variables are set and that providers and transformers are configured correctly when deploying resources for a new blueprint instance. The change staging process makes use of the final blueprint variables in producing a change set to be deployed, however, not all values can be resolved during change staging, especially where there are dependencies between resources. To account for this, the blueprint document is required along with blueprint variable overrides to resolve the remaining values during the deployment process.
- `destroy` - Used to ensure that providers and transformers are configured correctly when destroying resources in a blueprint instance. This command does not make use of an input blueprint file so blueprint variable overrides are not used.
- `validate` - Used to ensure that providers and transformers are configured correctly when validating a blueprint document. This command usually does not make use of blueprint variable overrides as validation is carried out on the source blueprint document and not a deployed instance. Plugins may provide custom validation logic that in advanced cases may require calls to APIs that require credentials and configuration.
- `plugins install` - Used to install plugins from a plugin registry defined in the `dependencies` section of the deploy configuration file.
- `plugins uninstall` - Used to remove the specified plugin from the `dependencies` section of the deploy configuration file along with uninstalling the plugin from the current system.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
This is not to be confused with the configuration for the CLI, this is purely for providing blueprint variable overrides and configuration for Deploy Engine plugins.
See [here](/docs/cli/configuration) for more information on configuring the CLI.
</Callout>

## Structure

The deploy configuration is a JSONC file that will usually be located in the root directory of a project in a file named `bluelink.deploy.jsonc` but this can be overridden with the `--deploy-config-file` option in the CLI.

This file is expected to contain the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "providers": {
    "<provider-name>": {
      "<key>": "<value> (string | number | boolean)"
    }
  },
  "transformers": {
    "<transformer-name>": {
      "<key>": "<value> (string | number | boolean)"
    }
  },
  "contextVariables": {
    "<key>": "<value> (string | number | boolean)"
  },
  "blueprintVariables": {
    "<key>": "<value> (string | number | boolean)"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "<plugin-id>": "<version-constraint> (string)"
  },
  "tagging": {
    "enabled": "<boolean>",
    "prefix": "<string>"
  }
}
```

`<provider-name>` is the name of the provider that is being configured. This name is the last part of the plugin ID for the provider. For example, for the plugin ID `registry.customhost.com/bluelink/azure`, the provider name would be `azure`.

`<transformer-name>` is the name of the transformer that is being configured. This name is the last part of the plugin ID for the transformer. For example, for the plugin ID `newstack-cloud/awsTransform`, the transformer name would be `awsTransform`.

For each provider and transformer, the keys and values are specific to the provider or transformer being configured. The valid keys and values can be found in the plugin documentation. The Deploy Engine will validate the configuration against the plugin schema when any of the `stage-changes`, `deploy`, `destroy` or `validate` commands are run unless the `--skip-config-validation` option is specified.

`<plugin-id>` is the ID of the plugin to install. There should be an entry for each transformer and provider that is used in the project.

`<version-constraint>` is the version constraint of the plugin to install, this can be in any of the following formats:
- `^1.0.0` - This will install the latest minor version of the plugin that is compatible with version `1.0.0` (e.g. `1.1.0`).
- `~1.0.0` - This will install the latest patch version of the plugin that is compatible with version `1.0.0` (e.g. `1.0.1`).
- `1.0.0` - This will install the exact version `1.0.0` of the plugin.

### Example

```javascript
{
  "providers": {
    "aws": {
      // It would be best to assume a role on the host machine
      // running the deployment instead of using access keys.
      "accessKeyId": "my-access-key-id",
      "secretAccessKey": "secret-access-key"
    }
  },
  "transformers": {
    "celerity": {
      "deployTarget": "aws-serverless"
    }
  },
  "contextVariables": {
    "myConfigKey": "my-config-value"
  },
  "blueprintVariables": {
    "region": "us-east-1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "newstack-cloud/aws": "~2.2.1",
    "newstack-cloud/celerity": "~1.5.0",
    "registry.customhost.com/my-org/gcp": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Dependencies

The `dependencies` section is used to install plugins from either the official plugin registry or custom plugin registries
configured in the CLI.

These are only used to install plugins for an instance of the deploy engine running on the same machine as the CLI.
For deploying to a remote instance of the deploy engine, the `dependencies` list is checked for compatibility based on plugins installed
for the remote instance.

Bluelink does **_not_** support transitive dependencies between plugins, you must declare all the plugins to be used by your project in the `dependencies` section.

### Tagging

The `tagging` section controls the behavior of Bluelink system-level tags that are applied to resources during deployment.
Bluelink automatically applies provenance tags to resources to help with tracking, auditing, and identifying resources that are managed by Bluelink.

<Callout title="User-defined tags" type="info">
The `enabled` setting only controls **system-level tags** that Bluelink automatically applies to resources.
User-defined tags specified in resource specs (e.g., in `metadata.labels` or provider-specific tag fields) will always be applied regardless of this setting.
</Callout>

The tagging configuration has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Controls whether Bluelink system-level tags are applied to resources. When `false`, only user-defined tags from resource specs are applied. |
| `prefix` | string | `"bluelink:"` | The prefix applied to all Bluelink tag keys. This can be customized to match your organization's tagging conventions (e.g., `"myorg:bluelink:"`). |

When tagging is enabled, the following system-level tags are applied to resources:

| Tag Key | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `{prefix}instance-id` | The unique identifier for the blueprint instance |
| `{prefix}instance-name` | The user-defined name for the blueprint instance |
| `{prefix}resource-name` | The logical name of the resource in the blueprint |
| `{prefix}resource-type` | The fully-qualified resource type (e.g., `aws/lambda/function`) |
| `{prefix}provisioned-by` | Marker indicating the resource is managed by Bluelink |
| `{prefix}deploy-engine-version` | The version of the Deploy Engine used for deployment |
| `{prefix}provider-plugin-id` | The identifier for the provider plugin (e.g., `bluelink/aws`) |
| `{prefix}provider-plugin-version` | The version of the provider plugin |

Example with custom tagging configuration:

```javascript
{
  "providers": {
    "aws": {
      "accessKeyId": "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}",
      "secretAccessKey": "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
    }
  },
  "tagging": {
    "enabled": true,
    "prefix": "myorg:bluelink:"
  }
}
```

Example with system-level tagging disabled:

```javascript
{
  "providers": {
    "aws": {
      "accessKeyId": "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}",
      "secretAccessKey": "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
    }
  },
  "tagging": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

## Multiple Environments

When you want to deploy a blueprint project to multiple environments, you can create a separate deploy configuration file for each environment.
For example, you could create a `bluelink.deploy.dev.jsonc` file for a development environment and set the `--deploy-config-file` option to
`bluelink.deploy.dev.jsonc` when deploying to the development environment.

## Version Control

The deploy configuration file is not intended to be version controlled when its contents is primarily used for credentials and blueprint variable overrides that can contain sensitive information.
However, for provider or transformer specific configuration and dependencies, in most cases it will be useful to commit sections of this file to version control.

### Environment Variable Substitution

When you want to commit configuration in the deploy configuration file to version control, you can commit the entire file and use environment variable substitution for sensitive information like so:

```javascript title="bluelink.deploy.jsonc"
{
  "providers": {
   "aws": {
      // It would be best to assume a role on the host machine
      // running the deployment instead of using access keys.
      "accessKeyId": "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}",
      "secretAccessKey": "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
    }
  },
  "transformers": {
    "celerity": {
      "deployTarget": "aws"
    }
  },
  "contextVariables": {},
  "blueprintVariables": {
    "region": "${REGION}"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "newstack-cloud/aws": "~2.2.1",
    "newstack-cloud/celerity": "~1.5.0",
    "registry.customhost.com/my-org/gcp": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

The Bluelink CLI will substitute the environment variables before making requests to the Deploy Engine.

### Template File

Alternatively, you can create a template file that contains the configuration you want to commit to version control and have placeholders for sensitive information that should be populated in the final file used with the Bluelink CLI.
You can then copy this template file to the final file used with the Bluelink CLI and populate the placeholders with environment variables or secrets loaded into a CI/CD or local environment from which you are deploying a blueprint.

```javascript title="bluelink.deploy.template.jsonc"
{
  "providers": {
    "aws": {
      "accessKeyId": "[placeholder__aws_access_key_id]",
      "secretAccessKey": "[placeholder__aws_secret_access_key]"
    }
  },
  "transformers": {
    "celerity": {
      "deployTarget": "aws"
    }
  },
  "contextVariables": {},
  "blueprintVariables": {
    "region": "[placeholder__region]"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "newstack-cloud/aws": "~2.2.1",
    "newstack-cloud/celerity": "~1.5.0",
    "registry.customhost.com/my-org/gcp": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

An example python script for populating the template file with environment variables:

```python title="generate_deploy_config.py"
import re
import os

def main():
    with open('bluelink.deploy.template.jsonc', 'r') as file:
        contents = file.read()

    env_vars = re.findall(r'\[placeholder__(.*?)\]', contents)

    for env_var in env_vars:
        value = os.getenv(env_var.upper())
        if value:
            contents = contents.replace(f'[placeholder__{env_var}]', value)

    with open('bluelink.deploy.jsonc', 'w') as file:
        file.write(contents)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

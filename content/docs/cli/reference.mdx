description: The reference for the available commands and flags for the Bluelink CLI
---

This section provides the reference for the available commands and flags for the Bluelink CLI.

Options that are marked with a `boolean` type are command line flags that do not take a value, however their config file and environment variable equivalents do take a value that should be set to one of `true`, `false`, `1` or `0`.

## Global Options

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
CLI options take precedence over [configuration](/docs/cli/configuration) from environment variables and values from a configuration file.
</Callout>

### `--config`

The path to the configuration file to source CLI configuration from.
Relative paths are expected to be relative to the current working directory.

**Type**: `string`

**Default Value**: `bluelink.config.toml`

### `--deploy-config-file`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_DEPLOY_CONFIG_FILE`

**Configuration Key**: `deployConfigFile`

**Type**: `string`

**Default Value**: `bluelink.deploy.jsonc`

The path to the deploy configuration file that contains blueprint variable overrides and configuration for providers and transformers.
This file is expected to be in the JSON with Commas and Comments format described in the [Deploy Configuration](/docs/cli/deploy-configuration) doc.

If the file is not found, the CLI will send empty configuration to the Deploy Engine, which will in most cases result in an error in the response from the Deploy Engine.

This file is used by the `stage-changes`, `deploy`, `destroy` and `validate` commands.

### `--connect-protocol`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_CONNECT_PROTOCOL`

**Configuration Key**: `connectProtocol`

**Type**: `string`

**Default Value**: `unix`

**Allowed Values**: `unix` | `tcp`

The protocol to connect to the deploy engine with,
this can be either `unix` or `tcp`.
A unix socket can only be used on linux, macos and other unix-like operating systems.
To use a `unix` socket on windows, you will need to use WSL 2 or above.

### `--engine-endpoint`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_ENGINE_ENDPOINT`

**Configuration Key**: `engineEndpoint`

**Type**: `string`

**Default Value**: `http://localhost:8325`

The endpoint of the deploy engine api, this is used if `--connect-protocol` is set to `tcp`.

### `--engine-auth-config-file`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_ENGINE_AUTH_CONFIG_FILE`

**Configuration Key**: `engineAuthConfigFile`

**Type**: `string`

**Default Value**: `engine.auth.json`

The path to the authentication configuration file for the deploy engine.
This is used to authenticate with the deploy engine when using the `stage-changes`, `deploy`, `destroy` and `validate` commands.

See the [Auth Configuration](/docs/cli/auth-configuration) documentation for more information on what is expected to be present in this file.

## `help`

For information on all the available commands and global options, run the following:
```bash
bluelink help
```

To get usage information for a specific command, run the following:
```bash
bluelink [command] --help
```

## `validate`

This command validates a blueprint file.
It will validate the project blueprint and other configuration files.

### `--blueprint-file`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_VALIDATE_BLUEPRINT_FILE`

**Configuration Key**: `validateBlueprintFile`

**Default Value**: `app.blueprint.yaml`

### `--check-blueprint-vars`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_VALIDATE_CHECK_BLUEPRINT_VARS`

**Configuration Key**: `validateCheckBlueprintVars`

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default Value**: `false`

This flag enables validation of the blueprint variable values that are set in the deploy configuration file.
By default, the CLI will not validate the blueprint variable overrides set in the deploy configuration file when validating a blueprint file.

### `--check-plugin-config`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_VALIDATE_CHECK_PLUGIN_CONFIG`

**Configuration Key**: `validateCheckPluginConfig`

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default Value**: `false`

By default, the validate command only runs validation on a provided blueprint file.
You can use the `--check-blueprint-vars` flag to validate the blueprint variable values set in the deploy configuration file.
By default, configuration specific to providers and transformers is not validated as a part of this command.
When this flag is set, the provider and transformer configuration sourced from deploy config files will be validated against the plugin configuration schemas.

## `stage-changes`

## `deploy`

## `destroy`

## `login`

This command logs into a plugin registry to allow the installation of plugins from specific protected registries by host.

An example of logging into a plugin registry:
```bash
bluelink login registry.customhost.com
```

The auth configuration for plugin registries is expected to be present in the `$HOME/.bluelink/auth.json` file.
See the [Plugin Registry Authentication Protocol](/docs/plugin-framework/registry-protocols-formats/auth-protocol) for more information on how to authenticate with a plugin registry.

## `init`

This command initialises a new blueprint project.
It will take you through a series of prompts to create a new blueprint project.
You can provide command line options to skip parts of the interactive process of setting up a new blueprint project.

## `plugins`

This is the command category for managing deploy engine plugins installed on the machine
that the CLI is running on.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
You can only manage plugins from the CLI for the machine that you call the CLI commands on.
These plugins will only be available when running commands such as `deploy` or `destroy`
against an instance of the deploy engine running on the same machine.
This is the default behaviour if a custom host is not specified for the deploy engine.
</Callout>

### `list`

Lists all the plugins that are installed on the machine that the CLI is running on.

#### `--type`

**Environment Variable**: `BLUELINK_CLI_PLUGINS_LIST_TYPE`

**Configuration Key**: `type`

**Allowed Values**: `provider` | `transformer` | `all`

**Default Value**: `all`

The type of plugins to list.

### `install`

Installs one or more plugins on the machine that the CLI is running on.
This command takes one or more plugin IDs as arguments.

An example of installing a single plugin:
```bash
bluelink plugins install bluelink/aws
```

An example of installing multiple plugins:
```bash
bluelink plugins install bluelink/aws bluelink/azure registry.customhost.com/bluelink/gcp
```

Plugins that exist in the bluelink registry do not need the full URL with the host name,
only plugins stored in a custom registry need the full URL.
For example, the plugin ID `bluelink/aws` will be resolved to `registry.bluelink.dev/bluelink/aws`.

The Bluelink CLI only supports sourcing plugins from a custom registry if it has been added to the
allowed registries, you can create a PR or contact the Bluelink team to get a custom registry
verified and added to the list of allowed registries.

As plugin IDs are globally unique, the CLI does not differentiate between provider and transformer plugins
for the sake of installation.

### `uninstall`

## `version`

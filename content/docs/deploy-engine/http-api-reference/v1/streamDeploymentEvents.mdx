          Stream events from the current deployment process for the given
          blueprint instance ID.


          This will stream events for new deployments, updates and for
          destroying a blueprint instance.


          This will return a stream of events as they occur or that have
          recently occurred

          over the Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol.

          The `Last-Event-ID` header can be used to resume the stream from a
          specific event ID.


          For a blueprint instance that has been destroyed, this stream will no
          longer be available

          to new connections once the destroy process has been succesfully
          completed.
